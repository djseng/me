   - Implemented and supported a large microservice based application that ran in Kubernetes hosted in Azure. The primary means of communication between the backend components was via KAFKA. Additional technologies included linux, mongo db, docker, graphana and open telemetry.

   The project began in net5.0 and I was responsible for migrating to net6.0. It also started in github and I assisted with migrating to gitlab, including creating debugging CI/CD problems.

   I maintained a portability layer which imported greenfield application in to the legacy system of truth. This involved ensure records landed in a legacy DB/2 system.

### Web Developer
- PII Jun 2001 - Sep 2010 · 9 yrs 4 mos

    I was involved in many different projects at PII. Originally, a majority of our web sites used classic ASP and VBScript with SQL Server back ends. We eventually migrated to JScript because we decided the syntax was less verbose and we could use JScript on both the client and server.

    PII mainly kept me working with their priority clients, although I did jump at a chance to work with an AS/400 iSeries we had acquired. During this time, a colleague and I were able to produce and deploy a WebSphere web service which interacted with a fairly large DB2 database. This was another moment in my career where team based development produced a great product.

    A few months before I transferred to their Dutch office `ASP.net` was really beginning to take hold in our office. I invested time honing my skills as a ASP.net developer.

   Websoft is where I got my start as a Developer. This is where I learned classic ASP and I picked it up quickly.

Eventually I was the sole developer, working from home, and I gave it up for a more stable environment.
