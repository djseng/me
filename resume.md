## Experience


### Web Developer
- Websoft, Inc. Feb 1998 - May 2001 Â· 3 yrs 4 mos

   Websoft is where I got my start as a Developer. This is where I learned classic ASP and I picked it up quickly. This company was only a small start up and was eventually dissolved during the big market drop in the late '90s. Eventually I was the sole developer, working from home, and I gave it up for a more stable environment.
