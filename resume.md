## Experience

### Web Developer
- PII Jun 2001 - Sep 2010 · 9 yrs 4 mos

    I was involved in many different projects at PII. Originally, a majority of our web sites used classic ASP and VBScript with SQL Server back ends. We eventually migrated to JScript because we decided the syntax was less verbose and we could use JScript on both the client and server.

    PII mainly kept me working with their priority clients, although I did jump at a chance to work with an AS/400 iSeries we had acquired. During this time, a colleague and I were able to produce and deploy a WebSphere web service which interacted with a fairly large DB2 database. This was another moment in my career where team based development produced a great product.

    A few months before I transferred to our Dutch office ASP.net was really beginning to take hold in our office. Since then I have been honing and developing my skills as a ASP.net developer.

### Web Developer
- Websoft, Inc. Feb 1998 - May 2001 · 3 yrs 4 mos

   Websoft is where I got my start as a Developer. This is where I learned classic ASP and I picked it up quickly. This company was only a small start up and was eventually dissolved during the big market drop in the late '90s. Eventually I was the sole developer, working from home, and I gave it up for a more stable environment.
